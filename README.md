# HumanActivityRecognition

These are codes to extract and tidy the mean and standard deviation of measurement made using the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set [1]

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable
computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and
Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new
users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from
the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is
available at the site where the data was obtained:
